I am a certified Deep Delta Doula (The Matrona), a certified childbirth educator (ACBE), and a certified Pediatric Sleep and Development Practitioner (PSAD). Motherhood has expanded me in ways I could never have imagined- it has stretched me, shattered me, and asked me to pick back up the pieces and rebuild. My son, Bixby, has been my clearest mirror and greatest teacher, asking me time and time again to call into question who I am, what I believe, and how I relate to this big, wild world and the realms beyond."}]},{"_type":"block","_key":"block2","style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"span2","text":"Before becoming a mother, I left behind a career in florals to become a birth and postpartum doula. I thought I understood birth because I had witnessed it many times and I thought I understood babies because I had been around them my entire life. When I fell pregnant, however, I heard a soft but palpable whisper that there was more- so much more- than the programming that I had been exposed to, and this started me on my journey of uncovering my own authenticity as a woman, as a mother, and as an educator. I birthed my baby at home and quickly found out that my understanding of infants and their needs was rooted in deception. My baby didn't need gadgets, swaddles, bottles, or training. He needed me. My skin, my smell, my voice, my heartbeat, my attuned presence. The rest was just noise- a fear based narrative that was created to lead us mothers and our babies to a place of scarcity, lack, sickness and fragmentation. It is my calling to stand as an advocate for the mutual nourishment, inspiration, fulfillment, and abundance that motherhood can bring. The time has come to leave the drained, exhausted, victimized mother archetype in the past- we don't need it any longer. Regenerative motherhood is the way forward."}]}]}
